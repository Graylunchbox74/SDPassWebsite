								SDPaSS is a community partnership designed to provide students with multiple pathways or “on-ramps” to quality employment through a credentialing system.
								This SDPaSS model uses meaningful, job-related experiences including internships, apprenticeships, certificates, associate and baccalaureate degrees to provide students with jobs, and businesses with well-trained employees. While the model can be replicated across the state and in many job categories, this initial SDPaSS will focus on three high demand areas: software development, network services and cybersecurity.
